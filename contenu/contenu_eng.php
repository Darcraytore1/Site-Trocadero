<br/>
Its full name is in fact: Place du Trocadéro-et-du-11-Novembre.
This place is located in the 11th district of Paris.
<br/><br/>
Its name was given in remembrance of the battle that took place on August 31, 1823, during which 
a French expeditionary force <br/>took the Trocadero fort from the hands of the Spanish liberal revolutionaries,
which defended the port of Cádiz in Spain and restored the authority of Monarch Ferdinand VII.
<br/><br/>
November 11th in the name of this place corresponds to the armistice of November 11th 1918 that 
marks the end of the fighting in World War I.
<br/><br/>
Its diameter is 164 meters, in its center is an equestrian statue of Marshal Foch and 
that of a monument to the glory of the French army (both created by Paul Labdowski).
<br/><br/>
It's a beautiful place, where the wind often blows because it's 
very open, this wind can annoy some people but it allows us however
<br/> to have a magnificent view over the whole garden of the trocadero as well as over the Eiffel Tower.

The Eiffel Tower is a puddled iron tower (refined cast iron) 324 meters high (with its antenna).
<br/><br/>
It is obviously located in Paris, in the 7th arrondissement, built by Gustave Eiffel and his
collaborators for the 1889 Paris Universal Exhibition. 
<br/>
Originally called the "300-metre tower", it has now become the symbol of the French capital.
<br/><br/>
It is also a big tourist site, it is the third most visited French cultural site, and
the most visited paying monument in the world with more than 300 million visitors
<br/><br/>
At a height of 312 meters, the Eiffel Tower remained the highest monument in the world for forty years.
<br/><br/>
This Tower, although known as the symbol of our capital, is not unique in the world. 
indeed in Japan is the Tokyo Tower.<br/>
This one is almost identical to the one we know, but there is a difference: 
its color is red and white.
