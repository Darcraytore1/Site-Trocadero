<br/>
	Its full name is in fact: Place du Trocadéro-et-du-11-Novembre.
	This place is located in the 11th district of Paris.
<br/><br/>
	Its name was given in remembrance of the battle that took place on August 31, 1823, during which 
	a French expeditionary force took the Trocadero fort from the hands of the Spanish liberal revolutionaries,
	which defended the port of Cádiz in Spain and restored the authority of Monarch Ferdinand VII.
<br/><br/>
	November 11th mention, corresponds to the armistice of November 11th 1918 that 
	marked the end of fighting in World War I.
<br/><br/>
	Its diameter is 164 meters and in its center, a statue of Marshal Foch and 
	a monument to the glory of the French army (both created by Paul Labdowski).
<br/><br/>
	It's a beautiful place, where the wind often blows because it's 
	very open, this wind can, however, annoy some people but allows us
<br/>
	to have a magnificent view over the whole garden of the trocadero as well as over the Eiffel Tower.

	The Eiffel Tower is a 324 meters high (with its antenna) puddled iron tower (refined cast iron).
<br/><br/>
	It is located in the 7th district (or 'arrondissement') of Paris and was built by Gustave Eiffel and his
	collaborators for the 1889 Paris Universal Exhibition. 
<br/>
	Originally called the "300-metre tower", it has now become the symbol of the French capital.
<br/><br/>
	It is also a big tourist site, it is the third most visited French cultural site, and
	the most visited paying monument in the world with more than 300 million visitors !
<br/><br/>
	At a height of 312 meters, the Eiffel Tower remained the highest monument in the world for forty years. 
<br/>
(It is true that to todays standards it's not that impressive...)
<br/><br/>
	This Tower, although known as the symbol of our capital, is not unique in the world. 
	In Japan, the Tokyo Tower closely resembles it...<br/>
	One major difference: 
	The red and white coloring
