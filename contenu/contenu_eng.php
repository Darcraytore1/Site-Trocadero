The Trocadero gardens are located in the 16th arrondissement, facing the Seine.
<br>
These have a surface area of 93,930 m².
<br><br>
This garden was created for the Specialized Exhibition in 1937, 
<br>
it replaced the previous garden of the Palais du Trocadéro (now replaced by the Palais de Chaillot),
<br>
This garden is now bordered by the Palais de Chaillot.
<br><br>
These gardens consist of a combination of fountains, plantations and aquarium,
<br>
The gardens are also punctuated by a muted culture, most of which dates from the 1930s.
<br><br>
The sloping paths that run along the pools are often used for rollerblading, among other things.
<br>
Apparently, you can see "riders", skidding down the slope and doing crazy tricks.
<br><br>
This site is served by the Trocadero metro station.

	Its full name is in fact: Place du Trocadéro-et-du-11-Novembre.
	This place is located in the 11th district of Paris.
<br/><br/>
	Its name was given in remembrance of the battle that took place on August 31, 1823, during which 
	a French expeditionary force took the Trocadero fort from the hands of the Spanish liberal revolutionaries,
	which defended the port of Cádiz in Spain and restored the authority of Monarch Ferdinand VII.
<br/><br/>
	November 11th mention, corresponds to the armistice of November 11th 1918 that 
	marked the end of fighting in World War I.
<br/><br/>
	Its diameter is 164 meters and in its center, a statue of Marshal Foch and 
	a monument to the glory of the French army (both created by Paul Labdowski).
<br/><br/>hill
	It's a beautiful place, where the wind often blows because it's 
	very open, this wind can, however, annoy some people but allows us
<br/>
	to have a magnificent view over the whole garden of the trocadero as well as over the Eiffel Tower.

	The Eiffel Tower is a 324 meters high (with its antenna) puddled iron tower (refined cast iron).
<br/><br/>
	It is located in the 7th district (or 'arrondissement') of Paris and was built by Gustave Eiffel and his
	collaborators for the 1889 Paris Universal Exhibition. 
<br/>
	Originally called the "300-metre tower", it has now become the symbol of the French capital.
<br/><br/>
	It is also a big tourist site, it is the third most visited French cultural site, and
	the most visited paying monument in the world with more than 300 million visitors !
<br/><br/>
	At a height of 312 meters, the Eiffel Tower remained the highest monument in the world for forty years. 
<br/>
(It is true that to todays standards it's not that impressive...)
<br/><br/>
	This Tower, although known as the symbol of our capital, is not unique in the world. 
	In Japan, the Tokyo Tower closely resembles it...<br/>
	One major difference: 
	The red and white coloring

The Champ-de-Mars is a vast public garden, entirely open. <br>
This garden is located in Paris in the 7th arrondissement, between the Eiffel Tower and the Eiffel Tower. <br>
to the northwest and the Military Academy to the southeast. <br>
<br>
It is 24.5 hectares in size, this garden is one of the largest green spaces in Paris.
<br><br>
It now welcomes Parisians and tourists all year round to a wide range of activities (except now:( )
<br><br>
It hosts concerts, exhibitions and fireworks, all free of charge.
<br>
To cite a few examples of great performances:
<br><br>
- On June 10th 2000, Johnny Hallyday performed a concert there, in front of more than 600,000 people.
<br>
- On Sunday 13 January 2013, La Manif pour tous is organising a 1,000,000-strong gathering on the Champ-de-Mars.
<br>
- Every year, on the evening of July 14, thousands of people come to watch the great 11pm fireworks display.
<br><br>
In 1765 the construction of the Military School, by Gabriel, leads to its destination.
<br>
So it was basically just a big country area.
<br><br>
This site is served by the metro 8, station Ecole Militaire.
